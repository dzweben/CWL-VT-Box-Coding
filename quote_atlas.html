<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 2: ” I think a lot of the stuff that I found in the School Counselor Box is very relevant to what I do on a daily basis with my students, like Kris was saying before…the post-it notes, everything like the research tools that I found in there to use just to reinforce with my students as they come into my office on a daily basis, have all been beneficial to the work that I do with my students.”</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 6: “Oh, and I think you made a point making this a combined kind of effort with SLL (skills for learning and life) would be a good partnership, because there&#x27;s so many topics that are very complementary that you could… at least even for the classroom teachers who are doing morning meeting and are using the SLL explicit lessons. I think this would be a good [idea]. I could see, having those positive affirmations, and those sticky notes being a great additional material to give out to the students to kind of..[as a] take away, or something that they stick on their desk because we can read it every day, or you know something to that nature.”</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 10: “So I would have like preferred more directions in terms of how to utilize this box to the fullest. So that I can get the best benefit out of this box in working with my students.”</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 7: “But I&#x27;m sorry! I&#x27;m listening to you guys, and I’m feeling so strange because I never applied it to us. I looked at the box - how to work with students.” Sort of applicable –</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 5: “Yeah. I agree with her. Actually, I believe that all the information we kind of know what to do. But it&#x27;s always good to have a refresher, and have a like.. an approach of how to do everything in little steps. So we can help not only students, but also, as the other friend.. colleague. was mentioning, other teachers”</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 3: It was more helpful to have the refresher to really kind of break it down. Because right now it&#x27;s so academically based in my job; like everything being in high school trying to get these kids graduated and everything. So to really break it down and reconsider and slow down and say, okay, what else is going on? Why is this student not…let me take a look, talk to the student and figure out what is going on in their life currently that&#x27;s blocking their path to graduation, so..</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 6: “Oh, and I think you made a point making this a combined kind of effort with SLL (skills for learning and life) would be a good partnership, because there&#x27;s so many topics that are very complementary that you could… at least even for the classroom teachers who are doing morning meeting and are using the SLL explicit lessons.

<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 9: “I would like tools that I can use with the students regarding the new [laws]. In Florida Governor Desatnis’ wife has a new initiative and it’s going to be turned into law. All school counselors in the district already received notification of that, but it has to do with resilience for students. So that’s what they are trying to focus on for middle school students: resilience. So if we could have a box that goes with this new legislation. Anything that is legislation friendly that I can use with a student. “</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 2: “I don&#x27;t recall if there was a 3 ring binder or dividers or folders in the box, because that&#x27;s what I use for my success groups to keep my seventh graders organized. I basically had a model presentation where I said, this is a 3 ring binder. You could put dividers in here, so you could separate your subjects and keep organized in addition to the student planner. So I think that those..you know… materials would be would be key to have. And I don’t think that was in the box other than the post its. So I think that might be something that could be added to the School Counselor Box .”</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 1: “you know, maybe not just those…not those supplies.. but maybe a list of things that would be helpful to students depending on their grade level. Like so a primary school counselor can look at it. Go, if you&#x27;re having issues with this student, here&#x27;s what you need. Maybe some supplies that you.. in your school could purchase. And not it be in the box, but just a list. And then middle school would need this, and then high school would need this. So, I like Evan&#x27;s idea, like you know, the binders, the agenda, or planner, or whatever you want to call it. You know those kind of things, you know, reaching out to parents. And maybe you know…some school counselors don&#x27;t like calling parents, but that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re supposed to do. So maybe some quick prompts of what to say to parents if they struggle because there are hard topics you&#x27;re gonna have to address.”</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 13: “Yeah. I know that the boxes tailored for school counselors to care for school counselors, but I would almost include students in on the conversation, too. Some kind of way to say, like we are people, too. And we are dealing with our own things, too. Kind of like the post it notes. Something to include students too. I don’t know. That’s what I would do I think.”</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 12: “You know I think self-help is definitely something that should be ongoing. I think that being able to maybe learn some more strategies. Maybe add more activities that we can actually practice. And I like to do activities that can help me. But, if I can do activities that help me and its also appropriate to help someone else, like a student…that’s the best of both worlds.”</div></div>

<details class="theme" id="theme-2" open><summary>Theme 2: Using box to share self care tools with other <span class="count">8 quotes</span></summary>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 5: But since I’ve had the box, it helped me to shown even more how I care about other teachers. And try to share with them, as I would say like this is, you know… that sometimes it&#x27;s important that we prioritize our mental health, and make sure that we are happy. So I am. ..I have been trying to care more about everyone - how their families are doing, how our day [ is going], and try to encourage them to take a little bit of time and try to accomplish one goal every day in regards to their personal life…or something that they want to accomplish. And then just do the things that they have to do at school. So the box has helped me a little bit more to work or get a closer approach to other teachers, and to reinforce [to] them that they do transmit to children and they need to be happy. We need to also look after ourselves.</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 6: “And I don&#x27;t know if this made me think of it more, or if it was just more validating of - oh, yeah, this is important to maybe continue to do that- maybe reach my circle a little bigger, not just my immediate team, but try to reach out to the teachers, who, I know you can tell that are in a funk and have, you know, an attitude that&#x27;s very difficult to deal with.”</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 3: Yeah, I was just gonna say, I think you know I was using the box for me, but also kind of providing it to the students, or I mean, I&#x27;m sorry ..the teachers. So you know it would be nice to just focus on myself. But with all the burnout and stuff I do want to support my teachers as well, my colleagues so..</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 11: “Well, you know, when I did open it up, and I started reading it, I was like, wow! This is just for me as a support to help me as a counselor, and you know other helpers within the field like teachers that I can share this information with”</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 10: “And as I was listening to the video, all I could think about is that I wanted to share this with some of my colleagues who are struggling particularly right now with things that&#x27;s happening within the school system.”</div></div>

<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 1: “You know what I mean. So it&#x27;s just having that collaboration happening. And then, when you say something, let&#x27;s do this, and we do. what are called opening rituals for our counselor PLCs every week, and we use stuff like this. The grounding and perspective taking, and just taking a sip of coffee or tea, or whatever, and just enjoying the moment.”</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 6: “I think I&#x27;ve done it mostly with my team as we have conversations, or we start talking about frustrations with…you know… our our school administration or campus…what&#x27;s going on. Just having personal… kind of.. relationships with the different people that are on my team.”</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 2: But it&#x27;s just the collaboration and teamwork in my school…. and this being my first year, seems to be pretty good all around. So that&#x27;s basically the kind of knowledge that I offer to my students….. So I think all those things combined are really something that contributes to, you know, self awareness.</div></div>

<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 4: “Well, I was aware of compassion fatigue and secondary trauma, or what do you call it… like, you know. But it was very good to actually have it broken down like when I listen to the video, the different lessons, and you know resources. Because I think a lot of times we feel guilty trying to take care of ourselves…. So yeah, I just needed permission.. for someone to say, you know you all are going through a lot, and you experience things almost on a level that police officers, and also in the medical field and things of that nature.”</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 5: “Yeah. I agree with her. Actually, I believe that all the information we kind of know what to do. But it&#x27;s always good to have a refresher, and have a like.. an approach of how to do everything in little steps. So we can help not only students, but also, as the other friend.. colleague. was mentioning, other teachers. Because sometimes we forget that there are many things going on behind.”</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 10: But a lot of the stuff that they talk about….I knew. But for me it was a reminder.. because, even though you know things ..just having that reminder, having somebody to say it out loud. Because, even though we may have it in the back of our mind, sometimes we forget. And even just thinking about taking care of myself…….So yeah, the video…even though much of the material wasn’t new, it brought it back for me. And I needed to hear that, again and again and again. “And even though the material isn’t new, it allowed me to think and process some things with myself. So for me that was the most helpful because I love to process what’s going on with me”</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 8: I enjoyed the videos. I really enjoyed the videos because even though we’ve learned the majority of it over our careers it gave a reminder, just like a refresher.</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 13: “I would say that using the word trauma really helped. I wasn’t really prepared to apply what I learned with crisis into this role but I think it made me realize I’m going to have to do that. I’m really lucky to have the box early into my career because I can kind of set things right from the beginning</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 11: So I know what it is because I have seen it, and I have experienced it. But the terminology literally put a stamp on it for me. To put it under a label. So that was one major learning curve for me from this box.</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 3: It was more helpful to have the refresher to really kind of break it down. Because right now it&#x27;s so academically based in my job; like everything being in high school trying to get these kids graduated and everything. So to really break it down and reconsider and slow down and say, okay, what else is going on?</div></div>
<details class="subtheme" open><summary>Subtheme 3.1: Feeling validated and supported by the box/ <span class="count">5 quotes</span></summary>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 9: “The first surprising thing ..in a positive way… is that this is a box for me. It&#x27;s not a box for me to help someone else. In all seriousness, that&#x27;s all I do the whole day. Every day I have a master&#x27;s degree in helping other people. Everything you give me. I&#x27;m going to try to implement in my practice. But the fact that this is for me it&#x27;s like a dream come true. I don&#x27;t want to explore this too much, but it&#x27;s just like oh, my gosh! Someone knows that there is secondary trauma in school counseling. And there is a book about it!” “So it was very…. how can I say? It gave me hope. The box gave something for me. And I like these stickies, because that&#x27;s what I thought I&#x27;m doing.. whenever . Not just for me…. that&#x27;s something that I can share with others. That is easy to share. And it brings me joy. So I really like the concept.”</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 11: Well, you know, when I did open it up, and I started reading it, I was like, wow! This is just for me as a support to help me as a counselor, and you know other helpers within the field like teachers that I can share this information with.</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 12: “But yeah, I realized when I heard and saw the video: I was like, ‘oh, that&#x27;s for us!’ I thought: ‘okay, this is neat!’ Cause normally, we don&#x27;t have anything that&#x27;s counselor focused, because we are the people that help students deal with trauma. And yet we, too, are affected by the same information that we hear. Even if indirectly, because it can be overwhelming and taxing to hear some of the things that you hear on a daily basis.</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 4: So yeah, I just needed permission.. for someone to say, you know you all are going through a lot, and you experience things almost on a level that police officers, and also in the medical field and things of that nature.</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 13: I thought it was a really cool concept, because counselor’, mental health and counselors’ care kind of fall second and falls 0 when it comes to admin. It was cool to have a reminder to think of yourself first. Fill your own cup before you can fill others kind of thing. I went through the box with my site supervisor, we got them together. It was a cool conversation starter for us, because I was asking her, “have you ever gotten anything like this before”. It was a cool conversation starter between us</div></div>

<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 10: “It does help me, the box. But I think, again as I said, just going back to re-listen, to remind myself to really continue to do self-care. Which for me means getting out and exercising and riding my bike, because I had stooped doing that for a while. And I can’t tell you why. But I stopped. And I realized I wasn’t feeling as rested and relaxed when I stopped. So I think for me, going back and listening to the video will be very helpful because I love to listen, and it just motivates me.” “Because as a professional, sometimes you just don’t want to stop, think about what’s going on around you and how that is impacting you as a person, as a professional. Because we really don’t want to have to deal with that because we have so many other things to deal with. To deal with all these other things…and still take care of me in the best way that I need to take care of me. So for me, that’s what I got out of it as well.”</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 6: I think it was a good stop, and just do. And get ready to take care of yourself because we know - Oh, yeah, yeah, I know, I know. But this was like, oh, I need to make this a priority and make sure… and just do some self-reflection.</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 4: so it&#x27;s kinda like I needed someone or that box to tell me, hey you know, take a break..recognize these signs. When you feel…. when you see it in the teachers, too… it&#x27;s very relevant. Because you&#x27;re…like , sometimes on some days like, why can&#x27;t this teacher like get it together… like they&#x27;re late. they&#x27;re you know..they&#x27;re forgetful, but they&#x27;re dealing with things, too. So it helps you to take a deep breath, step back and see how you can assist the person. And I found that a lot of the staff and teachers they have, you know, started coming in and sharing some things that you never would have known outside of..you know.. just them feeling comfortable enough to express themselves. And then you start looking at them like, wow, you know…. you&#x27;re doing a good job in spite of everything that you&#x27;re going through. So yeah, I just needed permission.. for someone to say, you know you all are going through a lot, and you experience things almost on a level that police officers, and also in the medical field and things of that nature.</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 12: “ All these people are depending on me. What am I going to do? And I neglect me. If don’t get me together first, I can’t do anything else. So I think this is good to really remind yourself to check on you first. Then you can go about what you need “</div></div>

<details class="subtheme" open><summary>Subtheme 3.3: Benefits of starting to use the term ‘trauma’. <span class="count">4 quotes</span></summary>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 11: So it was really insightful, some of the things that I was reading, things that I found out about. I had no clue about vicarious trauma. I had never heard that term before. I was able to learn a little more, and to categorize better what I had experienced, and not just pool it all into [being a counselor]. Maybe I need to do more self-care or I’m becoming overwhelmed because of burnout and stuff like that. ….. So I know what it is because I have seen it, and I have experienced it. But the terminology literally put a stamp on it for me. To put it under a label. So that was one major learning curve for me from this box. “So when this term was introduced, I’m reading more about it, and really considering my personal experience, and what I’ve been privy to in this field. And then I realize, this is something that I cannot ignore. I have accepted it, and I know that I have to pay more attention to self care.”</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 12: Well now I have a word. To describe what I was feeling. I didn’t put the term with what I was feeling. But before that yes, you know, I didn&#x27;t understand what I did. Well, now, I have a word to describe what I was feeling. But before that, I knew that as counselors we need counseling too. I’m an advocate for counseling, I think that it is helpful to have someone to talk to - not a family member or friend who is not a objective - to kind of really help you to process and guide you. Like you said, it’s self guidance. I always was seeking counseling for myself. Just to help me me process life. And give me some tools that I need to kind of overcome challenges without the judgement. You know how that is.</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 13: “I would say that using the word trauma really helped. I wasn’t really prepared to apply what I learned with crisis into this role but I think it made me realize I’m going to have to do that. I’m really lucky to have the box early into my career because I can kind of set things right from the beginning…… Yeah! That was one of those really helpful things. When I went through t with my supervisor, she was like, I&#x27;ve never really thought about that word trauma with what we go through sometimes. But she&#x27;s like, “but it&#x27;s true!” You do see some hard stuff. And it does really affect you.</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 4: I had something with the district that is called ‘Prepare’ and that was the first time that I actually learned about vicarious trauma. So I came back, and I was just talking [about] my mental health to anybody who would listen. I was so impressed that ….you know. And so I&#x27;ve heard it before, and I would just try to keep it alive and continue to address it year after year, because it&#x27;s so relevant to our job.</div></div>

<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 1: So it was just neat to do the things that I teach my kids to do, and I don&#x27;t normally do those things all the time.. I used to, and it&#x27;s like… I don’t know, “I don’t know about you, but when I go home I&#x27;m exhausted. I am mentally drained, physically, everything. Because you&#x27;re putting on a show.. like you&#x27;re there for the kids, you&#x27;re talking about the lessons, and you&#x27;re… I mean they&#x27;re really into it, but it&#x27;s like.. so much…it&#x27;s just heavy.

I would say that no one - at least that I’ve seen so far, at least at my school - really acknowledges that most of the counselors are glued to their phones on the weekends. And they have to be. And they are checking on their kids post-graduation. Because they have to be. They don’t really have clear boundaries. Nobody acknowledges that. Or god forbid says not to do that.</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 12: “Again, I’ve seen situations where educators are so burnt out that it starts to be the simple things they are forgetting. Like misplacing something important. So I definitely understand that part. Also I want to talk about the pandemic too. That was a big toll on everyone emotionally. I think if I had something like this at that time it would’ve helped me a lot. Especially when we were all remote it was very challenging and stressful.” “ Your name is on the loudspeaker. They are calling for you. So I always say to myself, you know ‘how can I do this??” All these people are depending on me. What am I going to do. And I neglect me. If don’t get me together first, I can’t do anything else. So I think this is good to really remind yourself to check on you first. Then you can go about what you need “ “It’s so true. We forget to take care of ourselves. The daily mantra of life, ‘I just have to do what I have to do’, or ‘someone needs me right now’ and you just go. But you don’t really take the time to eat, to think about what you need to get through your day. Maybe you had a rough night and you are coming into work and you have to put on a mask. Really, deep down inside, you need a moment, you need a space to debrief or to cry away from the view of others. To kind of gather yourself.”</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 11: “I’m like yeah how can I get more hours in my day to see this student or that student, to get this project done. Sometimes I go without lunch. And I still don’t have enough time to get things done. And then a teacher will look at me and be like “Ms. Smith this and this is going on and I asked you to see about it and you are not even taking it on, because this is important!” And I’m like, okay, it&#x27;s frustrating to me. Because I want to be there. I want to assist. But then I feel overwhelmed. And I feel like everything is just coming down on me. And we are the only school counselors, so it’s not as if there is someone else within my [department]. I mean we have our mental health worker and BHP, but there is no one else who is doing the same type of job that we are that we can go to and just let it all out”</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 10: , just going back to re-listen, to remind myself to really continue to do self care. Which for me means getting out and exercising and riding my bike, because I had stooped doing that for a while. And I can’t tell you why. But I stopped Because, even though we may have it in the back of our mind, sometimes we forget. And even just thinking about taking care of myself…. I was thinking of….I have a colleague…of having her to come and listen to the video as well. Because we talk about this all the time. You know.. the trauma that social workers and counselors and other helping individuals have. That we tend to be less [aware of]. We tend to forget that we need to be recharged as well. We need to be supported</div></div>

<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 4: Their households, I mean..you know we&#x27;re dealing with things... we&#x27;re still dealing with things post Covid. All the deaths that our kids and faculty and experienced. And we even experienced losing a faculty member.. two of them actually. So it&#x27;s just a lot.. it&#x27;s compounded. And that&#x27;s what the book really validated. It’s that it&#x27;s not just one thing. It&#x27;s multiple things. So..</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 9: This is the first year that I’m not thinking about covid…but then I stopped and thought, oh wait, it is about covid. Because the whole situation with Covid, in my opinion, caused a higher need for mental health services. I never had so many parents requesting support and school counseling for their kids like I had this year. This is just…oh my gosh. Not even during the two initial years of the pandemic, it wasn’t like this. Now I think we’re seeing the backlash from the pandemic in regards to mental health. Because the need for mental health services has increased. And the number of professionals hasn’t increased. So now we are having to service more kids and that increases the vicarious trauma! It’s all Covid but it’s not.</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 12: Listen. They think it’s easy to do that. I’m telling you, anybody that knows what it is like teaching kids behind a screen. It&#x27;s not the same. You need so many different activities and strategies. You need to destress and meditate because it’s not easy. They thought that at home we were relaxing. No. It was not. It was challenging at best.</div></div>

<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 11: I think that also the policy changes increased behavior issues since the pandemic until now. I see that even the teacher in my school, they are stress level has heightened. And because they have all this [pressure] in getting the curriculum done and having the kids… One teacher was telling me they had to do a topic that would normally take three weeks in one week. And it was so stressful for her to get it done. Doubly stressful for the students. And then when they start acting out, its like a rippling effect because nobody is settled. And then that trickles down to me, and there are more behavior complaints and more referrals. And it can feel overwhelming.</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 10: Yeah, it&#x27;s….you know, the different policies. Because you don&#x27;t know from day to day, because depending on which way the wind is blowing - policies change! And they don&#x27;t always tell you until the last minute. So there&#x27;s always this fear, at least for me, that I’m gonna miss something. This something is gonna happen. And I&#x27;m gonna be held accountable for it. So it’s those kinds of things. In addition to some of the stress that families and children are facing and some of the emotional baggage the kids are bringing. That&#x27;s pretty scary. Every day I go to work, it’s a fear. Because I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s gonna happen. And I don&#x27;t know always how to prepare for it. Because you can&#x27;t be everywhere, every day, every minute of the day. We have an expectation that you are supposed to be everywhere, and there&#x27;s only one of you and many of our children and families.</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 7: Yes, it’s too many things, and they are not really giving us A to Z training about something. Just fill out this form. Fill out this form. Fill out this form. I would say the instruction for us during training is not in order. If they will sit down and tell us, give us a solid example - an example that we actually deal with. And tell us, okay, at what point [you will] use this form. It&#x27;s just haphazard. Everything is haphazard Well, after the Marjory Stoneman act, all these trainings about suicide…suicide…suicide, and violence. But I feel like little bits and pieces are being thrown at us. Not one whole set of instructions. It’s confusing. My mind is confused about it. But this year, all these trainings, all this mental health information and all that being given to us…that is burning my brains out.</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 8: And it&#x27;s so much going on now with mental health. We’re overwhelmed with all the information and all the training that we have.</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 9: For me it&#x27;s the state of Florida legislation. It&#x27;s just every day I find something new. Yesterday I found out that there is a House bill….House Bill (HB) 1069 - that was approved, I think, the day before yesterday in the Florida Congress, and it&#x27;s going to the Florida Senate and then it&#x27;s gonna go to the Governor for his veto or not - that is, about no one in school until high School….something related to gender identity and supporting students. And at the same time.. the same day ..that I found that out, I&#x27;m having to deal with the suicide risk assessment of a student because of gender identity. So if this bill had already been approved…I would have to say, ‘student, I can’t’ I&#x27;m not counseling this student on that issue. But I wouldn&#x27;t even be able to have that student there, because the bill is restraining a lot of things that we can talk about in the school setting. So for me it&#x27;s the state of Florida that is to play, maintaining a lot of new laws and what we can have in our libraries for students and whatnot. That causes stress - having to scan 600 books in the library, otherwise you can&#x27;t use them. It’s tough</div></div>

And we have to do home visits and so forth to find out..you know. And then some of them move. Like I had a kid in my caseload that moved three times this school year. How do you learn like that? He was at Eagles Landing in Boca. Then he came to Congress middle, and then he moved all the way into Broward County. And I was like… I hope I helped him to the best of my ability. But I don&#x27;t know how you even learn with a teacher in a classroom when you&#x27;re transferring schools three times in one year. So, maybe more information on those kind of topics, and how we can work together, you know, as a team to be more proactive in a student’s academic life at the school.</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 13: Where there is less liability for their choices, you are way more invested with school counseling. With crises I would meet people once, mayber twice. And on the second time, that’s hard because you don’t want to meet them twice. With school counseling you are so much more invested. I have known people for months and I’m so invested I can’t imagine knowing them for 4 years, knowing people from freshman to senior year and then seeing them fail!? Ugh! That would gut you. That’s just for nomal things they fail at. Not even for when actual trauma happens or actual hard things happen. You are so invested and in it and you feel like they are a part of you. They are an extension of your own children!</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 1: when I go home I&#x27;m exhausted.

<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 9: The first surprising thing ..in a positive way… is that this is a box for me. It&#x27;s not a box for me to help someone else. In all seriousness, that&#x27;s all I do the whole day. Every day I have a master&#x27;s degree in helping other people. Everything you give me. I&#x27;m going to try to implement in my practice. But the fact that this is for me it&#x27;s like a dream come true. I don&#x27;t want to explore this too much, but it&#x27;s just like oh, my gosh! Someone knows that there is secondary trauma in school counseling. And there is a book about it!</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 11: Initially when I received that I thought that it would have been something that I could’ve used directly with my students. I assumed that it would have been skills and tools to use during a session or in conversation with a parent about a student. Something along those lines. That was my initial thought when I received the box Well, you know, when I did open it up, and I started reading it, I was like, wow! This is just for me as a support to help me as a counselor, and you know other helpers within the field like teachers that I can share this information with. So it was really insightful, some of the things that I was reading, things that I found out about.</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 12: But yeah, I realized when I heard and saw the video: I was like, ‘oh, that&#x27;s for us!’ I thought: ‘okay, this is neat!’ Cause normally, we don&#x27;t have anything that&#x27;s counselor focused, because we are the people that help students deal with trauma. And yet we, too, are affected by the same information that we hear</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 13: My supervisor! My supervisor when she opened it was like ‘wait, wait [no way this is for us!]!’</div></div>

<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 6: And I would say, too, that the quality of these materials is really impressive. Just, you know, putting it in my hands again, and touching it I&#x27;m like, wow, this…it&#x27;s… It&#x27;s very. very quality. Good job with that. I almost don&#x27;t want to use them because they&#x27;re too nice, if that makes sense.</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 5: Even the box [is really nice]</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 13: We watched that video together, that was really nice. Overall, I would just say that it catered to a lot of different attention styles. If I was more auditory there was things I could listen to, if I liked to read it more there were things I could read, if I’m a more physical learner there are things I can manipulate, it was really interactive in a lot of different ways.</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 1: So I thought that was really nice, and listening to the…um I won’t jump ahead, but I thought it was great.

<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 5: So I found it very useful.. the sticky notes with positive messages. So I make sure that they share with all their class teachers the message. And they have them on their wall, and I think it&#x27;s a good practice for them to read them daily.</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 11: [answering about what was most helpful…] Okay. The positive affirmations and the little sticky notes that tell you to take a pause to breathe. To do different activities to help you calm down. That was helpful as well. “So this box it actually helped because what I do is I take those sticky notes and I work with it, and I stick it on my computer. My office is different from my classroom, so I’ll stick it up, and that will be a reminder to me. Like you know what - all of this is going on, it feels like the space is going to burn down, but I need to focus on this for me. I need to do some deep breathing. I need to calm my mind before I extend myself to be more useful to those around me. “ “being able to reflect and look at these little sticky notes that I have, and remember that once I’m okay, I can then attend to things around me.” “I love the sticky notes, as I said, because it reminds me of what is important - taking care of me before I extend myself.”</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 2: So like when I need to get to something or I have to schedule a meeting or something like that, I have it all in, you know, the generalized area… like on my computer monitor or somewhere on my desk, so that I could, you know, reach and you know, get it when I need it. So the post that notes are definitely a vital thing that were in the box to me.</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 1: Well, I guess, like we said before, you know, the posted notes were very helpful. They&#x27;re easy, and they’re to the point, and they&#x27;re great reminders.</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 9: Affirmations are now in fashion. I notice it&#x27;s a thing now. It&#x27;s everywhere. Everybody is talking about it. People are doing affirmation tattoos, affirmation mindfulness kind of thing, affirmation yoga… And it’s not something new, it’s just being marketed. And that’s a good things because more people are going to use it. So I think the post its are very easy if you want to share something positive and quick with co-workers, and that helps us because it helps create a better work environment. It’s all connected. And I really like the book because I love reading. So that’s very subjective for me. The book was very good and I like the post its. But everything there is very useful.</div></div>

One of the things that I loved in this box was the introduction video. I think it was encapsulating. So it was sectioned off. It was orginized. It was engaging. And it really just brought the understanding of what this box was about in a short space of time. I really appreciated that.</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 13: I like the video.

<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 1: Well, I like the video because it gave examples, and that were very layman&#x27;s terms. And I like how she talked about this is, you know, people go through this, and just step by step, and the book helped as well.</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 4: I love the video.

<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 9: And I thought the video explained it very well.

<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 10: And as I was listening to the video, all I could think about is that I wanted to share this with some of my colleagues who are struggling particularly right now with things that&#x27;s happening within the school system.</div></div>

<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 6: I will say on a positive note, the book is phenomenal. I think that is something that needs to be shared with everyone. So we know how that&#x27;s impacting us and how we can, you know, work through that. It’s just applicable. It&#x27;s just very applicable to what we&#x27;re dealing with with our students, and how we&#x27;re trying to support them, and how that affects us, even when we realize we&#x27;re just kind of numb to it. It&#x27;s that..you know…compassion fatigue. It&#x27;s just it comes and goes, and how to recognize it, and what to do with it. I like the resources in the book the most. Just to continue to feed knowledge and reaffirm what we&#x27;re doing and why, and how to take care of ourselves.</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 3: Yeah, the book was great</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 4: And I was impressed.

And that&#x27;s what the book really validated. It’s that it&#x27;s not just one thing. It&#x27;s multiple things. So.</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 9: But the fact that this is for me it&#x27;s like a dream come true.

<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 13: I think that.. helpful. I actually have the book. The book! I like the book. And I also liked first of all, that the book is really interactive. I’ll say that. It is different than sitting and reading a chapter book. I really like that it’s interactive and you can kind of apply it to your experiences or future experiences. I also liked that going along with the specific definitions and examples, I liked that there was always the application of here is how it could affect you. Here is how it could affect your students. And here is what to do with that information. Because I think lot of resources I’ve experienced so far miss that last step. A lot of things are information heavy: here is what you need to know!” And then I feel a lot of the times, what do I do with that though! I’ve identified that, cool…but now what!</div></div>

<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 6: I think it was a good stop, and just do. And get ready to take care of yourself because we know - Oh, yeah, yeah, I know, I know. But this was like, oh, I need to make this a priority and make sure… and just do some self-reflection.</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 10: You know you&#x27;re talking about vicarious trauma. It’s that as a health professional, I think for me it’s very hard for me to admit sometimes that I’m suffering. That I’m having a reaction. Because I’m so busy taking care of other people. This box for me helped me to at least acknowledge it and say it outloud. That’s why I said to you [that] listening to the video, without having to talk, just listening and processing that [was helpful]. Because as professional, sometimes you just don’t want to stop, think about what’s going on around you and how that is impacting you as a person, as a professional. Because we really don’t want to have to deal with that because we have so many other things to deal with. To deal with all these other things…and still take care of me in the best way that I need to take care of me. So for me, that’s what I got out of it as well. “ For me it’s a work in progress. I&#x27;m not there yet, but it&#x27;s work. And I think about it. And it’s a work in progress and I have to mentally make myself do certain things. And I think for me, I haven’t done it recently, but I need to go back and listen to the video again. I think it’s just a timely reminder for me to take care of me so that I can give the best care to my students and families. “</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 11: I can go. As I said before, vicarious trauma, that term was new to me. But knowing about what it is, it’s something that I have experienced. It just brought more awareness to me. Because sometimes I feel something and I will just dismiss it as “okay well maybe I’m thinking too much into this, or not processing it properly.” I’ve been known to be a people pleaser. So then I wonder if it&#x27;s that I’m not doing enough self care. So when this term was introduced, I’m reading more about it, and really considering my personal experience, and what I’ve been privy to in this field. And then I realize, this is something that I cannot ignore. I have accepted it, and I know that I have to pay more attention to self care.</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 9: I have made more of an effort in terms of engaging in self care. I wasn’t necessarily successful, but at least! No sometimes I was successful! And that was thanks to the box! But it’s more in my mind. Like reading about it. Studying vicarious trauma [while] of course I know what it is, the fact that I received a box, as a school counselor, with a book there and that’s the purpose. I’m like okay. This is a thing. I need to do something about it. And its’ not just me.</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 13: I would say that using the word trauma really helped. I wasn’t really prepared to apply what I learned with crisis into this role but I think it made me realize I’m going to have to do that. I’m really lucky to have the box early into my career because I can kind of set things right from the beginning. Whereas someone like my site supervisor has been doing this for ten years and feels like “it hasn’t failed me yet” - so why would I change. So I think it has really helped with just being aware of how their experiences, hard experiences and even not that hard experiences -they don’t think it’s hard when they fail - being aware of how to manage myself in that. Knowing that I can’t shoulder all of their choices and their burdens and their responsibilities. And how even if I find myself doing it- what can I do then to stop it to revert it and to calm myself. So I would say yes [ there has been an impact]</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 1: Well, the post that notes are great, because I just stick them on my monitor, and they&#x27;re a good reminder, and using them with my team…that&#x27;s one thing you know, Evan had talked about. You know you have your team or you have…you know you go home, you&#x27;re exhausted, or whatever. But that&#x27;s what I love about middle school. Elementary….you, I, feel like you&#x27;re the lone wolf. That used to be me at Lake Park Elementary up in Riviera Beach. And now that I&#x27;m at Polo Park, I love when you have a team that works well together. I think, as adults. We forget to do that… and go go go, and we think we&#x27;re robots, and we&#x27;re not so. I do appreciate the post-it notes. Because they are a reminder, even though I see them all the time…they are a good reminder.</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 4: I guess I used it to bring up the conversation again to the BHP. And I will make sure that I incorporate it with our mental health team, the psychologists and everyone else, because it&#x27;s important, and it&#x27;s important to recognize it. A lot of the things that were stated…I do them unconsciously, anyway. Like I tried not to watch a lot of news first thing in the morning, Only when it&#x27;s necessary. I try to have something on that’s really funny in the morning, so I can get my day poppin’, you know. So a lot of the things I do unconsciously. But I want to make sure that the people who are around me and on my team… they&#x27;re doing it as well.</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 5: It also helped me. Well, I mean this is something that I always have done. But since I’ve had the box, it helped me to shown even more how I care about other teachers. And try to share with them, as I would say like this is, you know… that sometimes it&#x27;s important that we prioritize our mental health, and make sure that we are happy. So I am. ..I have been trying to care more about everyone - how their families are doing, how our day [ is going], and try to encourage them to take a little bit of time and try to accomplish one goal every day in regards to their personal life…or something that they want to accomplish. And then just do the things that they have to do at school. So the box has helped me a little bit more to work or get a closer approach to other teachers, and to reinforce [to] them that they do transmit to children and they need to be happy. We need to also look after ourselves.</div></div>

<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 1: The box really hasn&#x27;t changed the conversation. After we have an incident with a student, or they&#x27;ve told me something that&#x27;s happened with them at home that you know kind of prompts my brain like ‘oh, no’ or whatever…Then I talk that over with our BHP or another school counselor, if my BHP… It&#x27;s always with another person, because I&#x27;ll tell them what happened, and then they’ll ask me, how did you feel about that? Or did that prompt anything you know with what you&#x27;re thinking, or was that too much for you, or too heavy? Because..or do you think any changes happened with this student as..after they responded that way to you. And are they going to trust you. Those kinds of things. And so it just helps me figure out…okay…did I ask the student the questions that I really wanted the answers to? Or was I being reactive? You know, because we always like get caught in it sometimes, and we&#x27;re like, okay, hold the boat. Let&#x27;s focus on what we need to focus on. So yeah, it&#x27;s always nice to have somebody</div></div>
<div class="quote"><button class="copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.nextElementSibling.innerText)">Copy</button><div>Participant 7: I didn&#x27;t catch the question. But I&#x27;m sorry! I&#x27;m listening to you guys, and I’m feeling so strange because I never applied it to us. I looked at the box - how to work with students. Now I&#x27;m paying attention to vicarious trauma. I didn’t pay attention to those terms. I just looked at the box and you know “trauma” and “counselors”..so. Now I see…okay. That helps a lot! Now I understand the box more! (( NEW SECTION: . &quot;So I know what it is because I have seen it, and I have experienced it. But the terminology literally put a stamp on it for me. To put it under a label. So that was one major learning curve for me from this box.&quot;..“So when this term was introduced.... And then I realize, this is something that I cannot ignore. I have accepted it, and I know that I have to pay more attention to self care.” (P11) &quot;Well now I have a word. To describe what I was feeling. I didn’t put the term with what I was feeling. (P12) &quot; : “I would say that using the word trauma really helped. I wasn’t really prepared to apply what I learned with crisis into this role but I think it made me realize I’m going to have to do that. I’m really lucky to have the box early into my career because I can kind of set things right from the beginning…… Yeah! That was one of those really helpful things. When I went through t with my supervisor, she was like, I&#x27;ve never really thought about that word trauma with what we go through sometimes. &quot; (P13)</div></div>
