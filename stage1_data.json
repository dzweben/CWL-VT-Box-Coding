You know the grounding and the perspective taking all of those exercises. So I thought that was really nice, and listening to the…um I won’t jump ahead, but I thought it was great. And there were nice examples to start with. So it was nice to have post-it notes that I could put on my monitor and things like that and share them with my team, and they thought it was really important and cool too. So it was just neat to do the things that I teach my kids to do, and I don't normally do those things all the time.. I used to, and it's like… I don’t know, it just depends on your job. I'm a Middle School counselor,  I used to be an elementary, and I used to do it all the time myself. And now I’m middle school. It's crazy.

So I didn't have any ..like surprise reactions. I guess I would say I knew that they would be useful tools that I would be using on a daily basis that I found in that box. I think we received that at the School counselor Appreciation breakfast, which was back in February at the Hilton in West Palm Beach. So I'm grateful for the fact that I was given these tools to use with my students, and I was excited when I opened it and took the stuff out. So that's basically my reactions that I had to the box. Participant 2 had a huge learning experience as a new counselor; Says box is relevant to work with students and is useful; applies box to working with students rather than self, was grateful for the box"

And honestly, it’s nothing to do with the box, but it really pained me when I moved here. And you guys still call us guidance counselors…. that really hurt. It's like we're not guidance anymore. We're school counselors. So it's….I know it's a generational thing and it’s having to teach people what it's about. But no, it's very good information. I really think it's applicable to teachers, what's in that box. It's kind of like the foundational skills that teachers need to know, even though they don't like being the counselor.

I went to UMass Amherst. My college roommate’s… really almost best friend committed suicide at age 21. And back then I don't think he was getting the adequate help that he needed, and didn't have the right people there for him when he went through that. And that whole experience changed him forever. From what I knew of him and my junior year and senior year. So I didn't know really what to do, because I had actually met him. He had come up to college a few times to visit him. So I myself needed someone to talk to about this kind of issue, and I was, you know, reaching out to people that lived on my floor, and you know, people I was friends with, and so forth.  I think that because I have a caseload of approximately 250 to 300 students. It's a very large middle school….Congress is approximately 14,-1,500 students…It's very hard to provide that individualized attention to everyone who needs it. So, you know, like Kris said, it could be a daunting task, and it could also be exhausting at the end of the day, but it's also, you know, it's challenging, but rewarding at the same time."

So let's say you're working with a kid who is..you're going through a suicide risk assessment with. And you have your BHP alongside of you , you know, working with you. And then that other, the other school counselor that's not in the play…he or she is picking up the kids that you can't see, because you're in a suicide risk…. You know what I mean. So it's just having that collaboration happening.

The grounding and perspective taking, and just taking a sip of coffee or tea, or whatever, and just enjoying the moment. I think, as adults.

They won't even come to the school and meet with me so we can go over a students' grades…or find out…you know why they're so truan (truancy), why aren't they coming to school? Like I have kids in my caseload that like don't even come to school that have been absent for like 90 days. And we have to do home visits and so forth to find out..you know. And then some of them move. Like I had a kid in my caseload that moved three times this school year. How do you learn like that? He was at Eagles Landing in Boca. Then he came to Congress middle, and then he moved all the way into Broward County. And I was like… I hope I helped him to the best of my ability. But I don't know how you even learn with a teacher in a classroom when you're transferring schools three times in one year. So, maybe more information on those kind of topics, and how we can work together, you know, as a team to be more proactive in a student’s academic life at the school."

And not it be in the box, but just a list. And then middle school would need this, and then high school would need this. So, I like Evan's idea, like you know, the binders, the agenda, or planner, or whatever you want to call it. You know those kind of things, you know, reaching out to parents. And maybe you know…some school counselors don't like calling parents, but that's what we're supposed to do. So maybe some quick prompts of what to say to parents if they struggle because there are hard topics you're gonna have to address. And the more time you spend being a school counselor, and you have those experiences, the better you get -  hopefully - at talking to parents and staff and admin..and also advocating for your role. Like that's one thing that really.. I don't know what it is about Florida, but a lot of the Florida School counselors don't like saying what a school counselor should and should not do. And a lot of principles say, well, our hands are tied. I'm like no, they're not..you're the principal. It's all school based, and there are certain things that you have to do. Yes, and I'm willing to do that because… Evan mentioned about lunch duty….I do that as well. But I enjoy it.  I use it as a positive thing. I get to make connections with my students and build relationships. But it needs… I also need to,  and Evan also needs to… be able to speak to kids. Check in with kids, you know. Be there and have small groups. But we can't do that if we're doing everything but our job. So I guess what I’m trying to say is maybe having prompts for a different level of the school counselors or resources for them, so they know… they can have like a basis to start with."

Sometimes there's several phone numbers and none of them work. And then I'll reach out via email, and then I don't get a response.

When you feel…. when you see it in the teachers, too… it's very relevant. Because you're…like , sometimes on some days like, why can't this teacher like get it together… like they're late. they're you know..they're forgetful, but they're dealing with things, too. So it helps you to take a deep breath, step back and see how you can assist the person.

I'm like all right. I'm putting on my Pandora, and I'm listening to my Phil Collins. Just you know, to kind of keep myself in my own head space and that way when a kid walks in….

I've heard a little bit, I think, from conversations that your prior discussion of vicarious trauma or self-care, often comes from venting frustrations or trying to support teachers, for example. But it sounds like the work is relevant to what you do. Have you had other types of conversations besides, you know, kind of like informal venting like not in a judgmental way at all..but like informal conversations around, like debriefing or kind of just venting frustrations after a hard day around this topic? Or is there anything else about this topic that's especially relevant to what you do?  I think we're kind of covering it. I just want to make sure I open the space up."

So I think all the things you're saying are very relevant, you know. I laugh just because I had a recent situation where one person on the team was having a rough day, so I can empathize with that, you know. But the box helps to remind us we can support each other when they're having bad days, too. Yeah, definitely. So the next question is back to the materials: what do you think were the most helpful materials compared to the less helpful materials for the box. And we'll kind of just go into a conversation around like your recommendations or suggestions for enhancing the box, or if you would add anything to the box.

I moved here right before the pandemic and then lost some contacts and was teaching only online and things. But I'm working on getting back out in the community a little bit more.

I don't want to explore this too much, but it's just like oh, my gosh! Someone knows that there is secondary trauma in school counseling. And there is a book about it! And it’s really cool  because I sometimes joke that people think school counselors are seeing kids, and chit chatting with kids the whole day and watching cute cat videos. That's what people must think.  And yet i'm like this: this week I did 2 suicide risk assessments with 2 kids. Like this is...we do disheartening things. So it was very…. how can I say? It gave me hope. The box gave something for me. And I like these stickies, because that's what I thought I'm doing.. whenever . Not just for me…. that's something that I can share with others. That is easy to share. And it brings me joy. So I really like the concept. And I thought the video explained it very well. Although I watched it the day that we received the box, and that was back in February. But I remember the feeling of watching the video saying. Okay, I know why this is created. I do think we could have suggestions on how to use some of it. Because not everything I’m going to be able to come up with a fabulous idea [of how to use it] and suggestions are appreciated.

I was thinking of….I have a colleague…of having her to come and listen to the video as well. Because we talk about this all the time.

And at the same time.. the same day ..that I found that out, I'm having to deal with the suicide risk assessment of a student because of gender identity. So if this bill had already been approved…I would have to say, ‘student, I can’t’ I'm not counseling this student on that issue. But I wouldn't even be able to have that student there, because the bill is restraining a lot of things that we can talk about in the school setting. So for me it's the state of Florida that is to play, maintaining a lot of new laws and what we can have in our libraries for students and whatnot. That causes stress - having to scan 600 books in the library, otherwise you can't use them. It’s tough"

I never had so many parents requesting support and school counseling for their kids like I had this year. This is just…oh my gosh. Not even during the two initial years of the pandemic, it wasn’t like this. Now I think we’re seeing the backlash from the pandemic in regards to mental health.

Actually hearing more about what it is and how it impacts us as professionals, I was like oh this makes perfect sense. So I definitely think it’s good to be aware of that, because again, we can’t be helpful to others if we aren’t helping ourselves. Sort of like that old scenario with the plane, you can’t provide oxygen to someone else if you didn’t put your mask on first.  It’s so true. We forget to take care of ourselves. The daily mantra of life, ‘I just have to do what I have to do’, or ‘someone needs me right now’ and you just go. But you don’t really take the time to eat, to think about what you need to get through your day. Maybe you had a rough night and you are coming into work and you have to put on a mask. Really, deep down inside, you need a moment, you need a space to debrief or to cry away from the view of others. To kind of gather yourself. I think that it’s nice to try to have something to remind yourself that you need time for you. I have a problem of kind of burning both ends of the candlestick so to speak, where I tend to try to do everything. I’m like the jack of all trades, which means I’m the master of none. Because I’m so busy trying to do everything on my plate! All the tasks. And the tasks never end. Because you have a plan, and you go to work, and you know how that goes – your plan means nothing.

Because I want to be there. I want to assist. But then I feel overwhelmed. And I feel like everything is just coming down on me. And we are the only school counselors, so it’s not as if there is someone else within my [department]. I mean we have our mental health worker and BHP, but there is no one else who is doing the same type of job that we are that we can go to and just let it all out. So this box it actually helped because what I do is I take thos sticky notes and I work wihat th it, and I stick it on my computer.

I mean, I can’t keep up with all the changes. It’s more on us as educators because the changes always trickle down to our system. So that’s one thing that can cause issues. Because these things affect us not just as professionals, but it affects all of us in our lives. The decisions that are made. School safety is a big thing now, which is another level of stress. Making sure our kids are safe. [Wondering] am I doing the right thing? You know, everything you do, you wonder - did you do the right thing. Did you lock the door behind you. There is always a worry. So that’s added to everything else. So I think having a space to clear your mind and knowing that its you first. Getting that in order so you can make sure that you are on point. Because if you are not focused, and you don’t have a space to create calm, you are starting to forget now. Because you are all over the place.\n\nAgain, I’ve seen situations where educators are so burnt out that it starts to be the simple things they are forgetting. Like misplacing something important. So I definitely understand that part. Also I want to talk about the pandemic too. That was a big toll on everyone emotionally. I think if I had something like this at that time it would’ve helped me a lot. Especially when we were all remote it was very challenging and stressful."

And it was so stressful for her to get it done. Doubly stressful for the students. And then when they start acting out, its like a rippling effect because nobody is settled. And then that trickles down to me, and there are more behavior complaints and more referrals. And it can feel overwhelming. But, as Palema said, once you are able to find that calming space, being able to reflect and look at these little sticky notes that I have, and remember that once I’m okay, I can then attend to things around me.

They don’t have time to hear you complaining because they already have a million things on their table. So they don’t want to hear it. They’ll say yes to you, and okay. Go do what you have to do. Go do your job - that’s what people say. They are thinking it. They won’t say it but they might be thinking it. So I think that counseling would have been an option.

So what can I do now to get what I need in the moment if I need it. So that helps. The box helps in that way. It’s something I can utilize in that moment. I don’t have to make a phone call.

Now that I know that it is a real separate experience that we have, I definitely do agree with Pemala when she said that counseling is important for us to have as a resource to turn to. Everyone is on youtube so I can find videos to try and get more information about it. Definitely the box brought awareness. I’ll be honest, I haven’t finished reading the book yet, but that together with other resources to build on the information that I now know exists. That is a real situation that I have to address."

But because I think i'm all about people being different learners and receiving information differently - and I am a visual spatial learner, because I like to see things with my eyes and paint a picture in my head of a story. I just like a lot of visuals. Maybe it’s the elementary school counselor in me. I’d love something like a poster. Maybe a video image. That’s why I loved the intro video. I loved it because the presenter has come to my school so I was excited to see her on a video. Secondly, I did like the images. The video was really well put together. I loved it. It was really nice to watch it and kind of get an understanding of vicarious trauma. So that appealed to me. The video appealed to me the most. The perspective cards appealed to me also because the images and the stories behind images appeal to me. The post it notes I don’t mind, but because of the way I perceive information, I just more enjoyed the visual spatial. Everybody is different right. Some might be audio learners, who may want something like a meditation track. That might be something that could be in a second box. Something you can listen to. Some music, some sounds, some mediation instructions, calming soothing sounds. \n\nSo for example, I know during the pandemic, what appealed to my daughter when she was overwhelmed with the idea of being home and being away from everybody, we would pretend that we were traveling without really traveling. We would put on airplane noises and act like we were going somewhere. We would sit down and act like we were in a plane and we do that pretend. That was realy soothing and fun for her. She is a child but you know adults, we are advanced in our thinking but we still need some of the same things. Sometimes it’s back to basics with us. so I think that for the next box, maybe some more visuals. Maybe an audio piece to help along with the post its. And you could put on your own music of course, but maybe in school you can’t listen to certain types of songs, buf it it’s something that has been vetted and it’s soothing, I don’t think any educator would walk in and have a problem with soothing music. \n\nLike a guided meditation."

Maybe add more activities that we can actually practice. And I like to do activities that can help me. But, if I can do activities that help me and its also appropriate to help someone else, like a student…that’s the best of both worlds. I could use it for me and help you learn how to do it. This is another tool and strategy that you can put away for when you need. That’s how I like to work. It makes me function better. I also think, I know this is going to sound weird, because we think as a professional we should have these things down pat, but organization is another issues. \n\nI want to say I’m organized. But I always think, could there be an easier way for me to organize and manage my time differently. Not to say that it’s going to help me do way more because that’s not realistic. You can be as organized as you want to be, but you can’t predict the school environment. You just cannot. Because these are human beings that are coming in with things daily, and you don’t know what happened last night, this morning, you just can’t control those extraneous factors and variables in a day. But I would say if there was some ideas about how to organize and manage the time as professionals so that we can compartmentalize things in a different way. Maybe go back to some times. I like to find different ways to learn to organize myself. \n\nIt’s weird to say but it’s hard. I used to work in the high school level for many years. When I was working on a high school level, I had to come up with tracking systems that made it easier for me to track student graduation progress. It made it so much easier for me. And it was something that me and my colleague, who was very organized did together. She was very organized and I used to admire that. She was stressed. Don’t get me wrong she was stressed. But she was like look I need to do this so that it doesn’t overwhelm me. She had to find ways for the work not to overwhelm her. So she sat and planned and came up with a way to do a checkbox. So maybe something we can do that’s a checkbox, that is categorized, and maybe something that can be added to the next box, I’m not saying to this one, to kind of not only help you do self care but some better planning. So that you can minimize some of the overwhelming-ness."

And how do you cope with that?\n\nWhereas school counseling is less pressure. We just kind of guide, and it is up to the students to do what they will. There is less responsibility for outcomes. Where there is less liability for their choices, you are way more invested with school counseling. With crises I would meet people once, mayber twice. And on the second time, that’s hard because you don’t want to meet them twice. With school counseling you are so much more invested. I have known people for months and I’m so invested I can’t imagine knowing them for 4 years, knowing people from freshman to senior year and then seeing them fail!?  Ugh! That would gut you.

I finished by my internship, but the internship has more than enough going on. \n\nHowever, I really really like that it engages with specific mental health concepts. Because school counseling deals with mental health on the fringe. They are very clear that you may be a mental health support, but you are not a therapist. You aren’t there to use specific terminology, you are not there to help them figure out what they do or don’t have. That’s not what you are there for. You are there as a support to help with other mental health counselors like a therapist or case workers. I say that to say that I really like that this gives specifics, first of all. Because, I have mental training, but that’s me, I’m not all school counselors. School counselors in general come from an education background not a mental health background. So I like that this gives a lot of mental health specific information. Like here is what this word means, here is what it can look like. Here is what is can look like for students, or for yourself - mentally, physically, emotionally. Here is specfic information for that. And, here is how you can use that in your specific role. I think that was very very helpful. And I also liked first of all, that the book is really interactive. I’ll say that. It is different than sitting and reading a chapter book. I really like that it’s interactive and you can kind of apply it to your experiences or future experiences. \n\nI also liked that going along with the specific definitions and examples, I liked that there was always the application of here is how it could affect you. Here is how it could affect your students. And here is what to do with that information. Because I think lot of resources I’ve experienced so far miss that last step. A lot of things are information heavy: here is what you need to know!” And then I feel a lot of the times, what do I do with that though! I’ve identified that, cool…but now what!"

Whereas someone like my site supervisor has been doing this for ten years and feels like “it hasn’t failed me yet” - so why would I change. So I think it has really helped with just being aware of how their experiences, hard experiences and even not that hard experiences -they don’t think it’s hard when they fail - being aware of how to manage myself in that. Knowing that I can’t shoulder all of their choices and their burdens and their responsibilities. And how even if I find myself doing it- what can I do then to stop it to revert it and to calm myself.

At least people that are in my generation. But you can learn at any point. But people who are in my ‘school of learning’ - I guess - I’ve noticed are much more willing to learn and flexible. You are going to introduce a concept like ACEs and we’re like “that makes sense! yeah!” and then we kind of move forward.

You mentioned that flexibility..sometimes being in stress makes you less flexible. But also maybe having a certain kind of training.

They don’t really feel comfortable talking about mental health. They all know, for example, that if a student is struggling with suicidal thoughts, they know cognitively that they should say explicitly ‘are you having thoughts of killing yourself’ but none of them are comfortable saying it. None of them are comfortable actually having those thought conversations. So I did all of them! Because I was comfortable and I’ve done it 1000 times. I’ve had those hard conversations so many freakin times. I was the one, they’d always refer to me a lot. Like ‘what would you say to this person?’ Or ‘how would you go about this?’ A lot of different things! Eating disorders comes up a lot, and they don’t really know specific language to use. They know processes, if the student is a danger to themselves they know they have to tell mom. But they don’t know, what are the exact words I should say to this student, right now! They really struggle with that I think. And these are people who have been doing this for 7-10 years. They just really struggle with specific language to use when kids are struggling. When they say ‘I’m feeling depressed’ They struggle with what to say beyond ‘oh that sucks!’ They don’t really know what to specifically say!"

I went to UMass Amherst. My college roommate’s… really almost best friend committed suicide at age 21. And back then I don't think he was getting the adequate help that he needed, and didn't have the right people there for him when he went through that. And that whole experience changed him forever. From what I knew of him and my junior year and senior year. So I didn't know really what to do, because I had actually met him. He had come up to college a few times to visit him. So I myself needed someone to talk to about this kind of issue, and I was, you know, reaching out to people that lived on my floor, and you know, people I was friends with, and so forth.  I think that because I have a caseload of approximately 250 to 300 students. It's a very large middle school….Congress is approximately 14,-1,500 students…It's very hard to provide that individualized attention to everyone who needs it.

That used to be me at Lake Park Elementary up in Riviera Beach. And now that I'm at Polo Park, I love when you have a team that works well  together. So let's say you're working with a kid who is..you're going through a suicide risk assessment with. And you have your BHP alongside of you , you know, working with you. And then that other, the other school counselor that's not in the play…he or she is picking up the kids that you can't see, because you're in a suicide risk…. You know what I mean. So it's just having that collaboration happening. And then, when you say something, let's do this, and we do. what are called opening rituals for our counselor PLCs every week, and we use stuff like this. The grounding and perspective taking, and just taking a sip of coffee or tea, or whatever, and just enjoying the moment. I think, as adults.

And not it be in the box, but just a list. And then middle school would need this, and then high school would need this. So, I like Evan's idea, like you know, the binders, the agenda, or planner, or whatever you want to call it. You know those kind of things, you know, reaching out to parents. And maybe you know…some school counselors don't like calling parents, but that's what we're supposed to do. So maybe some quick prompts of what to say to parents if they struggle because there are hard topics you're gonna have to address. And the more time you spend being a school counselor, and you have those experiences, the better you get -  hopefully - at talking to parents and staff and admin..and also advocating for your role. Like that's one thing that really.. I don't know what it is about Florida, but a lot of the Florida School counselors don't like saying what a school counselor should and should not do. And a lot of principles say, well, our hands are tied. I'm like no, they're not..you're the principal. It's all school based, and there are certain things that you have to do. Yes, and I'm willing to do that because… Evan mentioned about lunch duty….I do that as well. But I enjoy it.  I use it as a positive thing. I get to make connections with my students and build relationships. But it needs… I also need to,  and Evan also needs to… be able to speak to kids. Check in with kids, you know. Be there and have small groups. But we can't do that if we're doing everything but our job.

It gave me hope. The box gave something for me. And I like these stickies, because that's what I thought I'm doing.. whenever . Not just for me…. that's something that I can share with others. That is easy to share. And it brings me joy. So I really like the concept. And I thought the video explained it very well.

So if this bill had already been approved…I would have to say, ‘student, I can’t’ I'm not counseling this student on that issue.

I mean we have our mental health worker and BHP, but there is no one else who is doing the same type of job that we are that we can go to and just let it all out. So this box it actually helped because what I do is I take thos sticky notes and I work wihat th it, and I stick it on my computer. My office is different from my classroom, so I’ll stick it up, and that will be a reminder to me. Like you know what - all of this is going on, it feels like the space is going to burn down, but I need to focus on this for me. I need to do some deep breathing. I need to calm my mind before I extend myself to be more useful to those around me."

I mean, I can’t keep up with all the changes. It’s more on us as educators because the changes always trickle down to our system. So that’s one thing that can cause issues. Because these things affect us not just as professionals, but it affects all of us in our lives. The decisions that are made. School safety is a big thing now, which is another level of stress. Making sure our kids are safe. [Wondering] am I doing the right thing? You know, everything you do, you wonder - did you do the right thing. Did you lock the door behind you. There is always a worry. So that’s added to everything else. So I think having a space to clear your mind and knowing that its you first. Getting that in order so you can make sure that you are on point. Because if you are not focused, and you don’t have a space to create calm, you are starting to forget now. Because you are all over the place.\n\nAgain, I’ve seen situations where educators are so burnt out that it starts to be the simple things they are forgetting. Like misplacing something important. So I definitely understand that part. Also I want to talk about the pandemic too. That was a big toll on everyone emotionally.

But because I think i'm all about people being different learners and receiving information differently - and I am a visual spatial learner, because I like to see things with my eyes and paint a picture in my head of a story. I just like a lot of visuals. Maybe it’s the elementary school counselor in me. I’d love something like a poster. Maybe a video image. That’s why I loved the intro video. I loved it because the presenter has come to my school so I was excited to see her on a video. Secondly, I did like the images. The video was really well put together. I loved it. It was really nice to watch it and kind of get an understanding of vicarious trauma. So that appealed to me. The video appealed to me the most. The perspective cards appealed to me also because the images and the stories behind images appeal to me. The post it notes I don’t mind, but because of the way I perceive information, I just more enjoyed the visual spatial. Everybody is different right. Some might be audio learners, who may want something like a meditation track. That might be something that could be in a second box. Something you can listen to. Some music, some sounds, some mediation instructions, calming soothing sounds. \n\nSo for example, I know during the pandemic, what appealed to my daughter when she was overwhelmed with the idea of being home and being away from everybody, we would pretend that we were traveling without really traveling. We would put on airplane noises and act like we were going somewhere. We would sit down and act like we were in a plane and we do that pretend. That was realy soothing and fun for her. She is a child but you know adults, we are advanced in our thinking but we still need some of the same things. Sometimes it’s back to basics with us. so I think that for the next box, maybe some more visuals. Maybe an audio piece to help along with the post its. And you could put on your own music of course, but maybe in school you can’t listen to certain types of songs, buf it it’s something that has been vetted and it’s soothing, I don’t think any educator would walk in and have a problem with soothing music. \n\nLike a guided meditation."

I also think, I know this is going to sound weird, because we think as a professional we should have these things down pat, but organization is another issues. \n\nI want to say I’m organized. But I always think, could there be an easier way for me to organize and manage my time differently. Not to say that it’s going to help me do way more because that’s not realistic. You can be as organized as you want to be, but you can’t predict the school environment. You just cannot. Because these are human beings that are coming in with things daily, and you don’t know what happened last night, this morning, you just can’t control those extraneous factors and variables in a day. But I would say if there was some ideas about how to organize and manage the time as professionals so that we can compartmentalize things in a different way. Maybe go back to some times. I like to find different ways to learn to organize myself. \n\nIt’s weird to say but it’s hard. I used to work in the high school level for many years. When I was working on a high school level, I had to come up with tracking systems that made it easier for me to track student graduation progress. It made it so much easier for me. And it was something that me and my colleague, who was very organized did together. She was very organized and I used to admire that. She was stressed. Don’t get me wrong she was stressed. But she was like look I need to do this so that it doesn’t overwhelm me. She had to find ways for the work not to overwhelm her. So she sat and planned and came up with a way to do a checkbox. So maybe something we can do that’s a checkbox, that is categorized, and maybe something that can be added to the next box, I’m not saying to this one, to kind of not only help you do self care but some better planning.

I finished by my internship, but the internship has more than enough going on. \n\nHowever, I really really like that it engages with specific mental health concepts. Because school counseling deals with mental health on the fringe. They are very clear that you may be a mental health support, but you are not a therapist. You aren’t there to use specific terminology, you are not there to help them figure out what they do or don’t have. That’s not what you are there for. You are there as a support to help with other mental health counselors like a therapist or case workers. I say that to say that I really like that this gives specifics, first of all. Because, I have mental training, but that’s me, I’m not all school counselors. School counselors in general come from an education background not a mental health background. So I like that this gives a lot of mental health specific information. Like here is what this word means, here is what it can look like. Here is what is can look like for students, or for yourself - mentally, physically, emotionally. Here is specfic information for that. And, here is how you can use that in your specific role. I think that was very very helpful. And I also liked first of all, that the book is really interactive. I’ll say that. It is different than sitting and reading a chapter book. I really like that it’s interactive and you can kind of apply it to your experiences or future experiences. \n\nI also liked that going along with the specific definitions and examples, I liked that there was always the application of here is how it could affect you. Here is how it could affect your students. And here is what to do with that information. Because I think lot of resources I’ve experienced so far miss that last step. A lot of things are information heavy: here is what you need to know!” And then I feel a lot of the times, what do I do with that though! I’ve identified that, cool…but now what!"

I’ve had those hard conversations so many freakin times. I was the one, they’d always refer to me a lot. Like ‘what would you say to this person?’ Or ‘how would you go about this?’ A lot of different things! Eating disorders comes up a lot, and they don’t really know specific language to use. They know processes, if the student is a danger to themselves they know they have to tell mom. But they don’t know, what are the exact words I should say to this student, right now! They really struggle with that I think. And these are people who have been doing this for 7-10 years. They just really struggle with specific language to use when kids are struggling. When they say ‘I’m feeling depressed’ They struggle with what to say beyond ‘oh that sucks!’ They don’t really know what to specifically say!"
