        "Participant 6: “Oh, and I think you made a point making this a combined kind of effort with SLL (skills for learning and life) would be a good partnership, because there's so many topics that are very complementary that you could… at least even for the classroom teachers who are doing morning meeting and are using the SLL explicit lessons. I think this would be a good [idea]. I could see, having those positive affirmations, and those sticky notes being a great additional material to give out to the students to kind of..[as a] take away, or something that they stick on their desk because we can read it every day, or you know something to that nature.”",

        "Participant 5: “Yeah. I agree with her. Actually, I believe that all the information we kind of know what to do. But it's always good to have a refresher, and have a like.. an approach of how to do everything in little steps. So we can help not only students, but also, as the other friend.. colleague. was mentioning, other teachers”",
        "Participant 3: It was more helpful to have the refresher to really kind of break it down. Because right now it's so academically based in my job; like everything being in high school trying to get these kids graduated and everything. So to really break it down and reconsider and slow down and say, okay, what else is going on? Why is this student not…let me take a look, talk to the student and figure out what is going on in their life currently that's blocking their path to graduation, so..",

        "Participant 9: “I would like tools that I can use with the students regarding the new [laws]. In Florida Governor Desatnis’ wife has a new initiative and it’s going to be turned into law. All school counselors in the district already received notification of that, but it has to do with resilience for students. So that’s what they are trying to focus on for middle school students: resilience. So if we could have a box that goes with this new legislation. Anything that is legislation friendly that I can use with a student. “",
        "Participant 2: “I don't recall if there was a 3 ring binder or dividers or folders in the box, because that's what I use for my success groups to keep my seventh graders organized. I basically had a model presentation where I said, this is a 3 ring binder. You could put dividers in here, so you could separate your subjects and keep organized in addition to the student planner. So I think that those..you know… materials would be would be key to have. And I don’t think that was in the box other than the post its. So I think that might be something that could be added to the School Counselor Box .”",
        "Participant 1: “you know, maybe not just those…not those supplies.. but maybe a list of things that would be helpful to students depending on their grade level. Like so a primary school counselor can look at it. Go, if you're having issues with this student, here's what you need. Maybe some supplies that you.. in your school could purchase. And not it be in the box, but just a list. And then middle school would need this, and then high school would need this. So, I like Evan's idea, like you know, the binders, the agenda, or planner, or whatever you want to call it. You know those kind of things, you know, reaching out to parents. And maybe you know…some school counselors don't like calling parents, but that's what we're supposed to do. So maybe some quick prompts of what to say to parents if they struggle because there are hard topics you're gonna have to address.”",
        "Participant 13: “Yeah. I know that the boxes tailored for school counselors to care for school counselors, but I would almost include students in on the conversation, too. Some kind of way to say, like we are people, too. And we are dealing with our own things, too. Kind of like the post it notes. Something to include students too. I don’t know. That’s what I would do I think.”",
        "Participant 12: “You know I think self-help is definitely something that should be ongoing. I think that being able to maybe learn some more strategies. Maybe add more activities that we can actually practice. And I like to do activities that can help me. But, if I can do activities that help me and its also appropriate to help someone else, like a student…that’s the best of both worlds.”"

And try to share with them, as I would say like this is, you know… that sometimes it's important that we prioritize our mental health, and make sure that we are happy. So I am. ..I have been trying to care more about everyone - how their families are doing, how our day [ is going], and try to encourage them to take a little bit of time and try to accomplish one goal every day in regards to their personal life…or something that they want to accomplish. And then just do the things that they have to do at school. So the box has helped me a little bit more to work or get a closer approach to other teachers, and to reinforce [to] them that they do transmit to children and they need to be happy. We need to also look after ourselves.",

Because, even though we may have it in the back of our mind, sometimes we forget. And even just thinking about taking care of myself…….So yeah, the video…even though much of the material wasn’t new, it brought it back for me.

So for me that was the most helpful because I love to process what’s going on with me”",

In all seriousness, that's all I do the whole day. Every day I have a master's degree in helping other people. Everything you give me. I'm going to try to implement in my practice. But the fact that this is for me it's like a dream come true. I don't want to explore this too much, but it's just like oh, my gosh! Someone knows that there is secondary trauma in school counseling. And there is a book about it!” “So it was very…. how can I say? It gave me hope. The box gave something for me. And I like these stickies, because that's what I thought I'm doing.. whenever .

And yet we, too, are affected by the same information that we hear. Even if indirectly, because it can be overwhelming and taxing to hear some of the things that you hear on a daily basis.",

It was cool to have a reminder to think of yourself first. Fill your own cup before you can fill others kind of thing. I went through the box with my site supervisor, we got them together.

Which for me means getting out and exercising and riding my bike, because I had stooped doing that for a while. And I can’t tell you why. But I stopped. And I realized I wasn’t feeling as rested and relaxed when I stopped. So I think for me, going back and listening to the video will be very helpful because I love to listen, and it just motivates me.” “Because as a professional, sometimes you just don’t want to stop, think about what’s going on around you and how that is impacting you as a person, as a professional. Because we really don’t want to have to deal with that because we have so many other things to deal with. To deal with all these other things…and still take care of me in the best way that I need to take care of me. So for me, that’s what I got out of it as well.”",

            "Participant 4: so it's kinda like I needed someone or that box to tell me, hey you know, take a break..recognize these signs. When you feel…. when you see it in the teachers, too… it's very relevant. Because you're…like , sometimes on some days like, why can't this teacher like get it together… like they're late. they're you know..they're forgetful, but they're dealing with things, too. So it helps you to take a deep breath, step back and see how you can assist the person. And I found that a lot of the staff and teachers they have, you know, started coming in and sharing some things that you never would have known outside of..you know.. just them feeling comfortable enough to express themselves. And then you start looking at them like, wow, you know…. you're doing a good job in spite of everything that you're going through.

I had never heard that term before. I was able to learn a little more, and to categorize better what I had experienced, and not just pool it all into [being a counselor]. Maybe I need to do more self-care or I’m becoming overwhelmed because of burnout and stuff like that. ….. So I know what it is because I have seen it, and I have experienced it.

Well, now, I have a word to describe what I was feeling. But before that, I knew that as counselors we need counseling too. I’m an advocate for counseling, I think that it is helpful to have someone to talk to - not a family member or friend who is not a objective - to kind of really help you to process and guide you. Like you said, it’s self guidance. I always was seeking counseling for myself. Just to help me me process life.

I used to, and it's like… I don’t know, “I don’t know about you, but when I go home I'm exhausted. I am mentally drained, physically, everything. Because you're putting on a show.. like you're there for the kids, you're talking about the lessons, and you're… I mean they're really into it, but it's like.. so much…it's just heavy.

If don’t get me together first, I can’t do anything else. So I think this is good to really remind yourself to check on you first. Then you can go about what you need “ “It’s so true. We forget to take care of ourselves. The daily mantra of life, ‘I just have to do what I have to do’, or ‘someone needs me right now’ and you just go. But you don’t really take the time to eat, to think about what you need to get through your day. Maybe you had a rough night and you are coming into work and you have to put on a mask.

Because I want to be there. I want to assist. But then I feel overwhelmed. And I feel like everything is just coming down on me.

I was thinking of….I have a colleague…of having her to come and listen to the video as well. Because we talk about this all the time.

Yesterday I found out that there is a House bill….House Bill (HB) 1069 - that was approved, I think, the day before yesterday in the Florida Congress, and it's going to the Florida Senate and then it's gonna go to the Governor for his veto or not - that is, about no one in school until high School….something related to gender identity and supporting students. And at the same time.. the same day ..that I found that out, I'm having to deal with the suicide risk assessment of a student because of gender identity. So if this bill had already been approved…I would have to say, ‘student, I can’t’ I'm not counseling this student on that issue. But I wouldn't even be able to have that student there, because the bill is restraining a lot of things that we can talk about in the school setting. So for me it's the state of Florida that is to play, maintaining a lot of new laws and what we can have in our libraries for students and whatnot. That causes stress - having to scan 600 books in the library, otherwise you can't use them. It’s tough"

And then some of them move. Like I had a kid in my caseload that moved three times this school year. How do you learn like that? He was at Eagles Landing in Boca. Then he came to Congress middle, and then he moved all the way into Broward County. And I was like… I hope I helped him to the best of my ability. But I don't know how you even learn with a teacher in a classroom when you're transferring schools three times in one year. So, maybe more information on those kind of topics, and how we can work together, you know, as a team to be more proactive in a student’s academic life at the school.",

And on the second time, that’s hard because you don’t want to meet them twice. With school counseling you are so much more invested. I have known people for months and I’m so invested I can’t imagine knowing them for 4 years, knowing people from freshman to senior year and then seeing them fail!? Ugh! That would gut you. That’s just for nomal things they fail at. Not even for when actual trauma happens or actual hard things happen. You are so invested and in it and you feel like they are a part of you. They are an extension of your own children!",

Every day I have a master's degree in helping other people. Everything you give me. I'm going to try to implement in my practice. But the fact that this is for me it's like a dream come true. I don't want to explore this too much, but it's just like oh, my gosh! Someone knows that there is secondary trauma in school counseling. And there is a book about it!",

I assumed that it would have been skills and tools to use during a session or in conversation with a parent about a student. Something along those lines. That was my initial thought when I received the box Well, you know, when I did open it up, and I started reading it, I was like, wow! This is just for me as a support to help me as a counselor, and you know other helpers within the field like teachers that I can share this information with. So it was really insightful, some of the things that I was reading, things that I found out about.",

And yet we, too, are affected by the same information that we hear",

        "Participant 11: [answering about what was most helpful…] Okay. The positive affirmations and the little sticky notes that tell you to take a pause to breathe. To do different activities to help you calm down. That was helpful as well. “So this box it actually helped because what I do is I take those sticky notes and I work with it, and I stick it on my computer. My office is different from my classroom, so I’ll stick it up, and that will be a reminder to me. Like you know what - all of this is going on, it feels like the space is going to burn down, but I need to focus on this for me. I need to do some deep breathing. I need to calm my mind before I extend myself to be more useful to those around me. “ “being able to reflect and look at these little sticky notes that I have, and remember that once I’m okay, I can then attend to things around me.” “I love the sticky notes, as I said, because it reminds me of what is important - taking care of me before I extend myself.”",

So the post that notes are definitely a vital thing that were in the box to me.",

People are doing affirmation tattoos, affirmation mindfulness kind of thing, affirmation yoga… And it’s not something new, it’s just being marketed. And that’s a good things because more people are going to use it. So I think the post its are very easy if you want to share something positive and quick with co-workers, and that helps us because it helps create a better work environment. It’s all connected. And I really like the book because I love reading. So that’s very subjective for me. The book was very good and I like the post its. But everything there is very useful."

It's just very applicable to what we're dealing with with our students, and how we're trying to support them, and how that affects us, even when we realize we're just kind of numb to it. It's that..you know…compassion fatigue. It's just it comes and goes, and how to recognize it, and what to do with it. I like the resources in the book the most.

I also liked that going along with the specific definitions and examples, I liked that there was always the application of here is how it could affect you. Here is how it could affect your students.

        "Participant 10: You know you're talking about vicarious trauma. It’s that as a health professional, I think for me it’s very hard for me to admit sometimes that I’m suffering. That I’m having a reaction. Because I’m so busy taking care of other people. This box for me helped me to at least acknowledge it and say it outloud. That’s why I said to you [that] listening to the video, without having to talk, just listening and processing that [was helpful]. Because as professional, sometimes you just don’t want to stop, think about what’s going on around you and how that is impacting you as a person, as a professional. Because we really don’t want to have to deal with that because we have so many other things to deal with. To deal with all these other things…and still take care of me in the best way that I need to take care of me. So for me, that’s what I got out of it as well. “ For me it’s a work in progress. I'm not there yet, but it's work. And I think about it. And it’s a work in progress and I have to mentally make myself do certain things. And I think for me, I haven’t done it recently, but I need to go back and listen to the video again. I think it’s just a timely reminder for me to take care of me so that I can give the best care to my students and families. “",
        "Participant 11: I can go. As I said before, vicarious trauma, that term was new to me. But knowing about what it is, it’s something that I have experienced. It just brought more awareness to me. Because sometimes I feel something and I will just dismiss it as “okay well maybe I’m thinking too much into this, or not processing it properly.” I’ve been known to be a people pleaser. So then I wonder if it's that I’m not doing enough self care. So when this term was introduced, I’m reading more about it, and really considering my personal experience, and what I’ve been privy to in this field. And then I realize, this is something that I cannot ignore. I have accepted it, and I know that I have to pay more attention to self care.",

But it’s more in my mind. Like reading about it. Studying vicarious trauma [while] of course I know what it is, the fact that I received a box, as a school counselor, with a book there and that’s the purpose. I’m like okay. This is a thing. I need to do something about it. And its’ not just me.",
        "Participant 13: I would say that using the word trauma really helped. I wasn’t really prepared to apply what I learned with crisis into this role but I think it made me realize I’m going to have to do that. I’m really lucky to have the box early into my career because I can kind of set things right from the beginning. Whereas someone like my site supervisor has been doing this for ten years and feels like “it hasn’t failed me yet” - so why would I change. So I think it has really helped with just being aware of how their experiences, hard experiences and even not that hard experiences -they don’t think it’s hard when they fail - being aware of how to manage myself in that. Knowing that I can’t shoulder all of their choices and their burdens and their responsibilities. And how even if I find myself doing it- what can I do then to stop it to revert it and to calm myself. So I would say yes [ there has been an impact]",

You know you have your team or you have…you know you go home, you're exhausted, or whatever. But that's what I love about middle school. Elementary….you, I, feel like you're the lone wolf. That used to be me at Lake Park Elementary up in Riviera Beach. And now that I'm at Polo Park, I love when you have a team that works well together. I think, as adults. We forget to do that… and go go go, and we think we're robots, and we're not so. I do appreciate the post-it notes. Because they are a reminder, even though I see them all the time…they are a good reminder.",
        "Participant 4: I guess I used it to bring up the conversation again to the BHP. And I will make sure that I incorporate it with our mental health team, the psychologists and everyone else, because it's important, and it's important to recognize it. A lot of the things that were stated…I do them unconsciously, anyway. Like I tried not to watch a lot of news first thing in the morning, Only when it's necessary. I try to have something on that’s really funny in the morning, so I can get my day poppin’, you know. So a lot of the things I do unconsciously. But I want to make sure that the people who are around me and on my team… they're doing it as well.",
        "Participant 5: It also helped me. Well, I mean this is something that I always have done. But since I’ve had the box, it helped me to shown even more how I care about other teachers. And try to share with them, as I would say like this is, you know… that sometimes it's important that we prioritize our mental health, and make sure that we are happy. So I am. ..I have been trying to care more about everyone - how their families are doing, how our day [ is going], and try to encourage them to take a little bit of time and try to accomplish one goal every day in regards to their personal life…or something that they want to accomplish. And then just do the things that they have to do at school. So the box has helped me a little bit more to work or get a closer approach to other teachers, and to reinforce [to] them that they do transmit to children and they need to be happy. We need to also look after ourselves."

Or did that prompt anything you know with what you're thinking, or was that too much for you, or too heavy? Because..or do you think any changes happened with this student as..after they responded that way to you. And are they going to trust you. Those kinds of things.

He was at Eagles Landing in Boca. Then he came to Congress middle, and then he moved all the way into Broward County. And I was like… I hope I helped him to the best of my ability. But I don't know how you even learn with a teacher in a classroom when you're transferring schools three times in one year. So, maybe more information on those kind of topics, and how we can work together, you know, as a team to be more proactive in a student’s academic life at the school."

I have known people for months and I’m so invested I can’t imagine knowing them for 4 years, knowing people from freshman to senior year and then seeing them fail!? Ugh! That would gut you. That’s just for nomal things they fail at. Not even for when actual trauma happens or actual hard things happen. You are so invested and in it and you feel like they are a part of you.
